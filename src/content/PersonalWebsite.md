# Short Text

Created this website in gatsby using React with no UI libraries.

# Full Text

I created this website using React. I also created a version using Hugo (very close to plain js/html/css). Right now, this website is still under development but I have implemented many complicated UI features without the use of any add on React libraries. Though using libraries would make development quicker and easier, it allowed me to better learn and demonstrate the skills needed for React development. Additionally, much of the website is dynamic and easily modifiable. I can animate any kind of line being drawn on the front page, have any text there, and can add a page like this just by adding a markdown file.
