# Short Text

Created this website in gatsby using React, creating all the UI effects myself.

# Full Text

I created this website using React. I also created a version using Hugo (very close to plain js/html/css). Right now, this website is still under development but I have implemented many complicated UI features without the use of any add on React libraries. Additionally, much of the website is dynamic and easily modifiable. I can animate any kind of line being drawn on the front page, have any text there, and can add a page just by adding a markdown file.
