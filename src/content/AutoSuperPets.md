Created a Deep Q Reinforcement Learning algorithm using pytorch to beat the game Super Auto Pets.

# Full Text

With a friend we recreated the popular game Super Auto Pets in python. I then created a Deep Q Reinforcement Learning algorithm using pytorch to try to beat the game. While this project is still in progress, it has successfully beat teams that grow exponentially stronger with level. I hope to improve the simulation and tune the AI to create a better model.
