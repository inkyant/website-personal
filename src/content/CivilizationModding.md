# Full Text

I created and published modifications for the history game Civilization, which garnered over 5000 downloads. This involved creating lua scripts, using the  SQL database, and modifying the source DLL in C++. I had to consider aspects of game design and did research into the history through books and articles. I also learned art asset creation techniques, like Photoshop and Blender.
