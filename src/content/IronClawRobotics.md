# Full Text

I was the programming director for FRC team 972 Iron Claw Robotics, and with my contributions our team led the top 8 alliance in the world. Along with with my work developing the software, I implemented industry standard code processes to help more people contribute to the team by creating a tasklist and creating PR procedures with unit tests and code reviews. I also created a curriculum to teach new students various aspects of robotics, from electronics to control theory to autonomous movement. I was also a part of the Curriculum Council making decisions on how to manage the 50 student team.
